# Course Overview

Students who successfully complete this course will gain an understanding of basic principles of computer systems design: modularity / abstraction, synchronization / concurrency, naming, and performance evaluation. They will understand multiple approaches to each design principle along with the background necessary to choose the right approach for a given situation. They will also understand how to apply these approaches to sample problems, which they will then be able to generalize to computer systems they encounter later.
Students will also gain experience implementing computer systems code. This experience will be invaluable in later courses such as embedded operating systems (operating systems kernel internals), database design, computer security, and distributed systems.

#  Course Outline
 * Introduction: dealing with complexity in computer systems
 * Organization of complex computer systems: fundamental abstractions
 * Modularity: clients & services
 * Modularity: virtualization (memory, CPU, computer)
 * Synchronization & concurrency: definitions & primitives
 * Synchronization & concurrency: usage examples
 * Approaches to naming in computer systems
 * Measuring and evaluating computer system performance
 * Security in computer systems: issues & mitigation

Where possible and appropriate, we will use examples from a wide range of modern complex computer systems to illustrate concepts covered in class.

 
# Prerequisites

The formal prerequisites for this class are CMPE 12 and either CMPE 13 or CMPS 12B, as well as familiarity with program- ming in C, which is taught in both CMPE 13 and CMPS 12B. Students are also expected to be familiar with tools such as make and git, but we will hold tutorials for those who would like a refresher.
While we expect you to know the material covered in the prerequisite classes, we realize that you may not remember all of it. This is OK, but you are responsible for reviewing the material—we won’t have time to cover prerequisite material in lecture or section after the first week.

# Resources 

We will use the textbook Principles of Computer System Design. We expect you to read the assigned sections in the book before the lecture in which we cover the material, so you’re prepared to ask questions and discuss the material.

Other than the textbook, all material for the class will be distributed and managed online using Canvas or Piazza. Canvas is used for assignments and grading, while Piazza is used for discussion and announcements.
 
# Academic honesty

Collaboration is a key part of research.  I encourage you to discuss the readings and the final project ideas with your classmates.  However, you must reveal the students with whom you discussed the assignments.  Failure to do so will result in formal disciplinary proceedings.  

I should not need to say so, but I do: plagiarism in any form is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.  As researchers, we always stand upon the shoulders of giants, and building upon existing work is the norm.  It is essential, however, that we provide proper attribution.  When in doubt, cite!  

# Assignments and Exams

## Exams

  

Needless to say, exams are going to look different as a consequence of remote instruction!  But they are an essential part of how we measure whether you are learning the material and it is on me to figure out the best workaround.  As of now, my expectation is that we will hold

There will be an in-class midterm (currently scheduled for April 9), and a final exam during the scheduled slot during exam week. You must take each exam at the scheduled time unless you are ill or have an unexpected family emergency (and have a note from a doctor, etc.)
